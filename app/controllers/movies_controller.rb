      # Look up the director and set to the director of the movie

      # Here is the POST params created by the form:
# {"utf8"=>"âœ“",
# "authenticity_token"=>"HhfjjvVuldiRbPZLs+ZA7LKu9s4gdGDdfzuCTrYNs27RJLo5ejkPRqvTeEBIeOe2x2l6/9cj1lGqcSHdRyn7iw==",
# "movie"=>{"title"=>"Star Wars", "year"=>"1977"},
# "director_id"=>"1",
# "commit"=>"Save Movie"}
      #
      # Note that the director_id is outside of the movie. This is because
      # ActiveRecord knows that the movie has a foreign-key relationship to
      # a director, but it doesn't know how to fill in the director_id.
      # We are going to use the director_id to look up the director
      # record, and then put this into the movie.
      #
      # There may be a more Rails-specific way to do this, but I don't
      # know what it is is.
      #
      # The movies table has a foreign key reference
      # to the directors table. So we are using the director_id that's in
      # the form to look up the actual director record. We can set this to a
      # director variable that looks like it's inside the movie class.
      # The reason that the movie class has a director instance variable
      # inside it is that we told ActiveRecord about the foreign-key
      # relationship between Movie and Director.
      #
      # Also, we are doing all of this in one line. How cool!
      movie.director = Director.find_by(params[:director_id])

      # Remember that nothing happens to the DB until we save!
      if movie.save
        # This is how you would print out error messages if a save operation
        # were to fail, and trigger a rollback or something like that.
